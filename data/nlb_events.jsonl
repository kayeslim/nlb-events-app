About the programme As AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini become part of daily life, a new challenge emerges —how do we think with it? This talk confronts the hidden cost of over-reliance: becoming a cognitive sloth . While AI accelerates outputs, it can dull our judgment, creativity, and sense-making skills. Drawing from research interviews and Flame Centre’s hands-on workshops, this session repositions AI not as a shortcut, but as a thinking partner. We explore how to lead AI with clarity, context, and critique to empower professionals in retaining their intellectual edge. Join us to unpack a framework that enhances human-machine collaboration and builds the cognitive muscles essential in an AI-driven world. Programme Objective To equip participants with a mindset and framework that enables them to lead, question, and collaborate with AI tools. To strengthen their critical thinking, judgment, and creativity to stay intellectually sharp and professionally relevant in an AI-driven world. Programme Outline Why Thinking Still Matters: In an age of powerful AI tools, why is preserving human judgment, creativity, and reasoning essential for effective decision-making? What AI Can Do and What It Can’t: AI excels at processing information but lacks the contextual understanding, values, and ethical grounding that humans bring. Therefore, knowing when and how to involve human thinking is key. Good vs Poor Use of AI: The value of AI depends on the user’s mindset – effective users lead the process with structured thinking, while poor users blindly follow, risking irrelevant or misleading results. Learning Outcomes: By the end of this programme, participants will be able to: Recognize the difference between using AI for speed versus using it to enhance thinking. Gain awareness of a practical framework to guide more intentional and structured use of AI tools. Reflect on the risks of over-relying on AI and the value of retaining human judgment, context, and critique.

The book serves as a conversation starter, helping parents understand their child’s preschool experiences and encouraging children to share their own feelings about school, friendships, and daily routines. Following the story, we bring the book to life with a music and movement session, featuring fun exercises from the story and our original Vegebu Exercise Song. Parents and children will move, stretch, and dance together, promoting outdoor play, mindfulness, and body awareness. About the Author Joy Artemis Ng is the author and artist behind Baby Leek & Friends. Her passion for storytelling began with bedtime tales for her son, inspiring her to establish The Rabbit’s Secret Stories, dedicated to creating connection and bonding through stories. She has conducted Baby Leek storytelling sessions in preschools to enthusiastic response. With over 1,000 recorded stories, she dreams of bringing her characters to life through books and animation, hoping one day a child will say, “I grew up reading your stories.”", "location": "21 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4 Lot One Shoppers' Mall, #04-01/02 and #05-06, Singapore, 689812", "tags": ["Workshop", "Choa Chu Kang Public Library – Programme Room 2 (Level 4)"], "action_url": "https://form.gov.sg/6873278d5b2210f532120305", "image_url": "https://www.nlb.gov.sg/eva/175237519191.JPG"}

Join us in discovering how this gallery of words and artefacts become bridges between generations, carrying personal and national stories, as we delve into the crosswords that riddle the language of history. Participants are welcome to bring items of their own relevant to the topic of discussion for sharing at the end of the programme. About the Books: Burn After Dawn (Landmark Books, 2024): From the gap of two generations, a young Singaporean poet interrogates the victors, vanquished and victims of Singapore’s surrender in 1945. The weighty records of the Japanese Occupation are questioned: air raids, the Battle of Opium Hill, the Alexandra Hospital massacre, Sook Ching, Kempeitai anarchy, comfort women stations. These, bound up with terrible family accounts, are examined through poetic lenses, sometimes magnified, other times widened, but unremittingly focused. About the Speakers: Sher Ting is a Singaporean writer who writes about history, tradition and the things that haunt us in between. She was a Writeability Fellow with Writers Victoria, and a member of Kenyon Review's Winter Workshop'23 and Tin House Winter Workshop'24. She has work published in Prairie Schooner, Pleiades, Gulf Coast, AGNI, Colorado Review, Quarterly Literary Review Singapore and elsewhere.

As this will be an interactive session, please come prepared to discuss the book and share your thoughts! About the Author Clara Chow (赵燕芬) is the author of Dream Storeys , Modern Myths , Not Great But At Least Something and Tales from the K-pop . Besides fiction, she has also published travelogues New Orleans and Caves , as well as a Chinese-English poetry collection 几首烂情诗/Lousy Love Poems . Her strange experiments under Hermit Press include obscure prose chapbooks such as The Melancholy of Broken Bollards . About the Book What if you could dream up any building you like? What would it be? How would constructing it change our lives? A shopping mall self-destructs, and a single mother vanishes. A tree house for orphans and old folks is torn apart by an act of mercy. The Singapore Flyer is reinvented as a political prison. In this collection of nine tales, Clara Chow examines an alternative Singaporean landscape—one that exists only on paper—and the people we might be in it. A former newspaper correspondent, she interviews nine architects about chimeric structures and sets short stories in them. A hybrid of journalism and fiction, Dream Storeys documents the voices of urban visionaries, while taking their ideas into inventive, evocative new territories. This programme is held in conjunction with the URA Draft Master Plan 2025. About Singapore Literature Book Club From NLB’s Singapore collection comes a book club with a unique local flavour. Discuss books by both well-known and emerging Singaporean authors touching on topics close to home. Get acquainted with local literature and discover national literary treasures right here at the libraries. To find out more about NLB's literary art events, join our mailing list at https://go.gov.sg/la-edm ! About URA Draft Master Plan 2025 The Draft Master Plan 2025 showcases islandwide land use plans and strategies for more inclusive, accessible homes and neighbourhoods; refreshed business nodes and vibrant workspaces; and a more resilient Singapore that is better able to respond to economic, social and climate challenges in the years to come. Building on the strategies developed in the last Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) in 2022, the DMP2025 translates them into detailed land use plans that will guide Singapore’s physical transformation over the next 10 to 15 years. Together, these proposals aim to create a more liveable, inclusive and endearing Singapore, by offering Singaporeans from all walks of life with more choices for living, working and leisure, as well as a deepened sense of identity and place. The DMP2025 is shaped through URA’s most extensive public engagement exercise to date, with URA engaging almost 220,000 people for their feedback on development plans of varying scales. As Singapore celebrates 60 years of independence (SG60), DMP2025 presents a milestone in our development as a city-state and is an opportunity to reflect on our shared journey as a nation. URA invites you to visit the DMP2025 Exhibition to learn about the plans for Singapore and their neighbourhoods. You can also sign up for guided tours of the exhibition hosted by URA volunteers at https://go.gov.sg/URADraftMasterPlan The exhibition will subsequently be brought to several neighbourhoods islandwide.

Over the decades, women across all communities have advanced from traditional roles into key contributors in education, politics, the economy, and civic life, supported by progressive policies and ground-up movements advocating for gender equality. This broader transformation has set the foundation for increasingly diverse and dynamic expressions of female empowerment across the nation. Within this nationwide evolution, Malay/Muslim women have charted their own distinct yet interconnected path. Historically anchored in roles as caregivers and nurturers, they have emerged as influential agents of community development and social change. Drawing on historical narratives, community initiatives, and contemporary research, this talk examines how Malay/Muslim women—often underrepresented in mainstream discourse—have played a crucial role in strengthening social cohesion, advancing educational aspirations, and fostering empowerment within their community. The session will also address the unique challenges faced by Malay/Muslim women, including navigating cultural expectations, systemic inequalities, and the pressures of modern life. Finally, it invites reflection on the future of leadership and participation, especially among younger generations, encouraging a model of sustainable, inclusive, and faith-conscious community growth that builds upon the rich legacy of empowered roots.

Inspired by the patchwork blankets of her grandmothers, Adel will investigate cultural memories of domesticity, care, and grief through patchwork. In this participatory exhibition, attendees are invited to be inspired by aNERDgallery's Batik Tambal collection and to collectively patch on the artwork as they reflect on their personal healing journey.

Orkestra Melayu Singapura will kick things off with a vibrant medley blending heritage hits and contemporary tunes. They’ll then hand the reins to NADA, the experimental duo of Safuan Johari and Rizman Putra, who will take us on a sonic time-trip, deconstructing and reassembling golden-era Malay pop from the 1960s to 1980s into captivating retrolicious tracks. Shimmy on down to join us for this unforgettable night of non-stop grooving and joyful tribute to the sounds that shaped us! About the Performers Established in September 1991, Orkestra Melayu Singapura's story is one of passion, resilience and cultural revival. Born out of their deep love for Singapore Malay music, Orkestra Melayu Singapura (OMS) emerged in response to the need to preserve and promote this rich musical heritage. Through vibrant performances, educational initiatives and community outreach programmes, OMS has not only showcased the diversity and beauty of Singapore Malay music but has also served as a platform for aspiring musicians to hone their craft and realise their potential. NADA is a visual arts/sound project that explores the myth and synthetic history of a fabricated group of the same name. A concept developed by Rizman Putra and Safuan Johari, the Singaporean duo blurs the line between fiction and reality, summoning hauntological soundscapes and seeking lost futures. Since 2014, NADA’s brand of music and performance has gone beyond Singapore to Beijing, Paris, London and New York.

Using materials from the National Archives of Singapore—such as 19th-century hydrographic charts, oral history recordings, and declassified government documents—Dr Hadi Osni examines how place names, ecological knowledge, and kinship ties offer alternative ways of remembering and representing these maritime landscapes. The talk highlights how archival materials can be recontextualised through memory mapping and participatory research. About the Speaker Dr. Hadi Osni is a curator at the Malay Heritage Centre under Singapore’s National Heritage Board. His research focuses on architectural and urban history, community heritage, and spatial memory in Singapore’s built environment. He is Co-Investigator of the NHB-funded project Socio-Cultural Heritage of Jurong Island and Former Offshore Islands (2023–2025), where he led oral history, archival, and GIS research to document the lives of former island residents.

Language and translation as the dominating tool of the British Empire 4. How colonialism impacts one's identity, belonging, and even loyalties & more! About the author Rebecca F.

The programme uses fantasy storytelling, art-making, and one-on-one mentorship to help every child discover the magic within themselves. The programme best experienced as a complete 6-session journey rather than just a single session. Each week adds to the adventure, helping children gradually create their own fantasy world, step by step, story by story. Through books, craft, and imagination, children build their own fantasy worlds, complete with monsters, heroes, magical landscapes, and brave adventures. Along the way, they gain confidence, learn to express themselves, and experience the power of being seen, heard, and supported. Imagine opening a book and watching the pages come alive all around you. Colour floods the air. Magic stirs. And suddenly—your child has become a fantasy writer. This creative journey begins with Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone .

At the heart of this programme is the belief that every child holds a world within them and one shaped by memory, imagination, fear, hope, and story. That’s why every participant is paired with a volunteer mentor who: ❤️Listens without judgment ❤️Encourages personal expression ❤️Reflects the child’s imagination and emotions ❤️Offers a moment of attuned presence and safety This mentorship, along with the programme’s structure, draws on psychological research that shows how children thrive when their inner lives are seen and mirrored. The creative process becomes a way for them to explore their identities, process emotion, and build resilience. This programme offers that space for children to imagine, speak, and tell their stories. The result? A box full of monsters, maps, heroes, and a child who feels more confident, creative, and capable of telling their own story.

Spacebar is designed for anyone who writes, from complete amateurs to established aficionados, to create in community, connect, and share with like-minded peers.

It can be lonely and plagued with self-doubt. Spacebar offers no quick fixes, but it provides a supportive environment where writers can gather, be mutually inspired, and navigate the beautiful challenges of your craft together. Join our monthly sessions to connect with a community that embraces the raw and vulnerable act of creating. Details This session of Spacebar runs from 12pm - 3pm . Spacebar is a monthly session that offers writers a regular space to focus on their craft. Feel free to come and go as you like! During the session, we will have breaks where you'll be able to mingle with other writers to share, seek advice, and offer support on all things writing and literary. We believe in the power of serendipitous connections and the collective wisdom of the community to meet one another’s needs.

Along the way, they gain confidence, learn to express themselves, and experience the power of being seen, heard, and supported. Imagine opening a book and watching the pages come alive all around you. Colour floods the air. Magic stirs. And suddenly—your child has become a fantasy writer. This creative journey begins with Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone . Children read alongside trained mentors who offer gentle guidance and encouragement and launch into creative exploration through art and writing. 2) Programme Dates*: 10 Aug | 24 Aug | 7 Sep | 21 Sep | 2 Nov | 16 Nov (This programme best experienced as a complete 6-session journey.) *For each date, there are 2 similar sessions in AM (10:30am-12:30am) and PM (1:30pm-3:30pm) for selection based on your preference and availability. 3) More Programme Details: Each session offers a magical experience from experiencing below- 🧚‍♀️Make a wand, enchanted creatures, and magical hats from shiny paper and twigs 🧚‍♀️Craft shadow puppets and mysterious maps as the lights grow dim 🧚‍♀️Build a fantasy planet in a box—jungles, forests, or floating islands 🧚‍♀️Create a hero and write a thrilling action scene 🧚‍♀️Collect stamps at every session—gather all six to earn a special wizarding toy! 🧚‍♀️End the journey with a family showcase and take home your own story and fantasy box 👍More than just a fun activity! At the heart of this programme is the belief that every child holds a world within them and one shaped by memory, imagination, fear, hope, and story. That’s why every participant is paired with a volunteer mentor who: ❤️Listens without judgment ❤️Encourages personal expression ❤️Reflects the child’s imagination and emotions ❤️Offers a moment of attuned presence and safety This mentorship, along with the programme’s structure, draws on psychological research that shows how children thrive when their inner lives are seen and mirrored. The creative process becomes a way for them to explore their identities, process emotion, and build resilience. This programme offers that space for children to imagine, speak, and tell their stories. The result? A box full of monsters, maps, heroes, and a child who feels more confident, creative, and capable of telling their own story. For the best experience, join us for all six magical sessions as each one builds on the last to create a complete adventure. 4) About the Programme Organisation & Organiser: Heartland Literature is a Literary Arts education initiative.

Their poems invite us into a world where dreams blur with reality, and where death is more than an end: could dreams be a source of wonder or despair, and is death an event to be feared or embraced? Through their poems about dreams and death, we will discover what it means to see the world through the eyes of a Romantic who finds meaning in multiplicity rather than absolute truths.

Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is a cautionary tale, urging thoughtful reflection on the consequences of scientific and technological advancement. However, the titular scientist’s fear of his own creation warns against unchecked scientific ambition and emphasises the creator’s ethical responsibility toward his creation. Today, the figure of the Frankenstein monster challenges us to rethink humanity and identity beyond traditional boundaries in a cyborgian future where life is ‘more-than-human’. Rather than fearing monstrous possibilities, how might Shelley's work encourage us to reflect critically on our evolving relationship with technology?

More than a century later, Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) pulls back the curtain on Bertha’s backstory, reimagining her as a woman shaped by love and loss, and existing in the shadows of colonialism. How do we see her as more than just an arsonist? A madwoman? A victim?

Edwin Thumboo’s early poetry called for a new, post-colonial Singapore—a nation built by and for its own people, no longer in the shadow of colonial rule. Poems like “ May 1954 ” and “ Ulysses by the Merlion ” capture that spirit of hope and reclamation. But what happens when that nation-building project succeeds—and in doing so, erases the very landscapes and memories his poems celebrated? This talk explores the tensions in Thumboo’s work: between past and progress, memory and modernity, and the changing meaning of “home” in a city that never stands still.

Through visual poems that speak across languages and poems in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQ) that invite your participation, discover how poetry can be both playful and profound. Interpret logographs together (no idea what that is? Find out on the day itself!), vote for your favourite interpretations, and even create your own alternatives - while also hearing about the behind the scenes of each poem’s creation. No prior experience needed. This interactive session welcomes poetry lovers and newcomers to engage with poetry in unexpected ways. Come ready to interpret and discover how the textual and visual intersect in experimental forms of poetry. About the Book Burn After Dawn (Landmark Books, 2024): From the gap of two generations, a young Singaporean poet interrogates the victors, vanquished and victims of Singapore’s surrender in 1945. The weighty records of the Japanese Occupation are questioned: air raids, the Battle of Opium Hill, the Alexandra Hospital massacre, Sook Ching, Kempeitai anarchy, comfort women stations. These, bound up with terrible family accounts, are examined through poetic lenses, sometimes magnified, other times widened, but unremittingly focused. About the speaker Sher Ting is a Singaporean writer who writes about history, tradition and the things that haunt us in between. She was a Writeability Fellow with Writers Victoria, and a member of Kenyon Review's Winter Workshop'23 and Tin House Winter Workshop'24.

We’ve had a variety of topics, ranging from cooking a steak, the psychology of learning, to the tech behind Google Docs. No two Learning Days are the same – the topics depend on what participants share. We love the spontaneity, and sometimes discovering “unknown unknowns” from other folks. If you’re interested but not sure what to share, just show up! We believe that everyone knows something, be it from school, work or hobbies. You don’t need to be an expert (most of us aren’t), and you may be surprised by what comes to mind after hearing a few sharings. We meet in person every 1st Saturday of the month.

We hope you abide by the guidelines and also the intent. Feel free to clarify with the organisers if needed. - We are laymen and share based on our personal understanding. We don't know everything (and that's okay!) - We create our own Learning Day experience. Everyone has something to share, e.g. from work, school and hobbies - We can ask questions during a sharing, unless the person who is sharing requests to keep questions to the end - Our questions come from a place of learning, curiosity, and respect - When someone is sharing, the focus is on them. We can share our views while keeping this in mind - We keep an open mind and listen to all points of view, including views which we may not share - We are mindful of each other’s time by keeping to ~15 min per sharing - If a topic doesn't interest us, no worries, it's a chance to hear something different and will be over in 15 min anyway! - This is not a platform for seeking singles/dating or selling/advertising products and services.

Spacebar is designed for anyone who writes, from complete amateurs to established aficionados, to create in community, connect, and share with like-minded peers.

It can be lonely and plagued with self-doubt. Spacebar offers no quick fixes, but it provides a supportive environment where writers can gather, be mutually inspired, and navigate the beautiful challenges of your craft together. Join our monthly sessions to connect with a community that embraces the raw and vulnerable act of creating. Details Spacebar meets on the last Sunday of every month from 12pm - 5pm, either at Central Public Library or library@harbourfront , to offer writers a regular space to focus on their craft. Feel free to come and go as you like! You will have opportunities to meet and mingle with others during the session.

About the Programme library@chinatown celebrates Mid-Autumn Festival The Mid-Autumn Festival—often reductively called the \"Mooncake Festival\" today—originated in shamanistic moon worship, far removed from its contemporary commercialized celebrations. Its evolution reveals a fascinating interplay of gender, power, and cross-cultural exchange in Tang China (618-907 CE), where lunar myths were rewritten by imperial desire. This lecture will shed light on important evolution of mythologies and stories: Emperor Xuanzong’s 8th-century moon fantasy inspired by Central Asian aesthetics and Indian melodies and the secularisation of the festival. Beyond food for thought, you’ll be given surprisingly simple poetic recipes from the distant past proving that ancient traditions can adorn in modern kitchens in the most romantic way. Speaker Gong Pan Pan (Hanfugirl) is a Singaporean traditional aesthete, independent researcher, and educator specializing in Chinese fashion history and material culture. She is known for re-presenting Chinese history through a modern, aesthetic, and female-centric lens—blending photography, storytelling, and scholarship to make historical knowledge accessible to global audiences. With a background in fine arts and English literature, Pan Pan merges artistic expression with historical research, challenging stereotypes and drawing connections between past and present.
